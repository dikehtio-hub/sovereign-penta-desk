# DEV — Sovereign Quad-Desk Trading Ecosystem

Handoff log between Claude Code and Antigravity. Terse by design; git history has
the detail.

## Status

Round 26m complete. **The repository now has version history** — it had none
through ~12 rounds of work. Two commits: the baseline (`743496b`, 526 files) and
the reconcile alias (`5e188a5`).

Suites, all offline:

| suite | count |
|---|---|
| Sports_Desk master + bridges (9 modules) | 680 OK |
| Tax_Reserve_Agent (4 modules) | 524 OK |
| HL_Monarch | 904 passed |

Tax config is **New Jersey resident** (Union, 07083): composite 32.37% =
24% federal + 6.37% NJ + 2% buffer, `casual_standard_deduction`.

## What changed

- **`.gitignore` written before the first commit, not after.** `Keys/` holds a
  *screenshot of a HyperLiquid API key*; two live `.env` files; `*.db` carries a
  real tax position. A committed secret survives deletion — it stays in every
  clone — so these never entered history.
- **`quant_trading_lab/` is excluded and that is deliberate.** It has its own
  git repo. Staged from the parent it becomes a bare gitlink: it *looks*
  version-controlled while tracking nothing. It versions itself; the outer repo
  stays out of its way.
- **Three secret-scan hits were checked, not assumed.** The `connection_id` and
  `r`/`s` values in `HyperLiquid/HL_Monarch/execution/wallet_manager.py` are
  EIP-712 test vectors sitting beside `"private_key": "0x" + "11" * 32`. The
  base64 hits in `MoonDev_Quant_Strats/.../chart_benchmark_*.html` are chart
  image data. All false positives.
- **`--reconcile` added as an alias of `--check-sync`** on `monarch_shark`, with
  a test — an argparse alias regresses silently.

## Next / open questions

- **The drop path is `data/imports`, not `data/drop`.** Round 26m specified
  `Tax_Reserve_Agent/data/drop/`; that directory does not exist and nothing reads
  it. `config.yaml -> imports.drop_folder` and `csv_watcher.DEFAULT_IMPORTS_DIR`
  both resolve to `data/imports`. An export to `data/drop` would look like it
  worked and import nothing. A test now pins `TAX_DROP_DIR ==
  DEFAULT_IMPORTS_DIR` so they cannot drift.
- **No remote is configured.** Nothing is pushed anywhere. Before adding one,
  re-check `.gitignore` — the secrets argument only holds while the history is
  local.
- **The multi-state problem is not modelled.** A travelling contract worker
  resident in NJ owes roughly `max(NJ, work-state)` per dollar after the
  other-jurisdiction credit — higher in NY, lower in PA — and betting while
  physically in another state can source winnings there. The single 6.37% is the
  right approximation for a NJ resident; it is not a return.
- `professional_schedule_c` is permanently barred under *Groetzinger* while the
  x-ray contract work continues. Do not re-open it.
